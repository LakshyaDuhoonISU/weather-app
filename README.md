Hooks are functions that allow us to access the features of React. 
- useState hook allow us to create and manage state variables whose values once changed, trigger a component rerender. They retain their value even after a component rerenders. It consists of the state variables and a setter function to set their values.
- useEffect hook allows us to execute some particular functions after a change in the component's lifecycle. It consists of the code to execute and an array of dependencies, which consists of elements whose values once changed, will call the useEffect hook.
